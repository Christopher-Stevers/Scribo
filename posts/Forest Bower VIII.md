Despite his men's cries of support, our lad could tell they were disturbed his inexperience. How could they not be? Few 1000 year old ammortals would trust a child of under 100 years as their leader. The center of this discontent was the lad's dear friend Kushlova. He was a great warrior, but still greater as a councillor. Yet, despite his great age, Kushlova's wisodm was combined with the energy of a youth.
This morning, as the lad armed hismelf in a suit of dark mail, Kushlova approached him. "That is a fine suit of mail, my lord."

Though they knew the broken ones were near the first of battle was a black arrow that glanced from the princlings helm. Immediately teh lads troop hid themselves and melted into the cover. Following their example the lad took his position beside Kushlova, who pulled him in tight behind a tree. Then the men began, at Kushlova's direction to flit from tree to tree barely losing their cover but slowly advancing. Though he'd many times heard of his people's famous forest fighting, he hadn't grasped it until he was a part of it. HE began advancing with Kushlova's direction / protectio,n, and after what seemed like an eternity Kushlova and the lad burst behind a tree where a pair of enemies was hiding.
