Despite his men's cries of support, our lad could tell they were disturbed his inexperience. How could they not be? Few 1000 year old ammortals would trust a child of under 100 years as their leader. 

The center of this discontent was the lad's dear friend Kushlova. He was a great warrior, but and greater as a councillor. Yet, despite his great age, Kushlova's wisodm was combined with the energy of a youth.

This morning, as the lad armed hismelf in a suit of dark mail, Kushlova approached him. "That is a fine suit of mail, my lord."
"Yes my lady orderred it from the smiths of Glencora."
"Eh, She fears for you. I am told it's your first battle. Did you ever do battle in your former life?

When the lad heard mention of his former life, the memory was like tale of another man's past, so much had this new life changed him. Surprised at the question, he replied: "No, the only strife in my land was mere sport , and rarely was that martial in nature. As for my lady fearing for me, is that not to be expected?

"True when I bid farewell it was to a wet eye and a red cheek as well. Yet you are young and inexperienced . . . " At this Kushlova left with with trouble on his brow.

Fear and boldness raced through the lad's mind. He could not deny that he was ill prepared, but a king he had come to expect greater respect from his officers.

The morning of the battle dawned bright and glorious. Scouts had reported the enemy to be only two hours distant, so the sentries were alert and the men had been on edge through the night. The night sight of their foes was legendary and they'd come to expect suprises from the darkness.

In bright mail the lad set out at the head of his troop with skilled woodsmen at his side. Because of the thickness of the wood and a clinging myst their view and progress were encumbered and they didn't encounter the enemy til the third hour. Though they knew the broken ones were near, they were suprised by a black arrow that glancing off the princes helm.

Immediately the lad's troop melted into the cover. Following his men's example the lad took his position behind a tree with Kushlova. Then the men began, at Kushlova's direction to flit noiselesslyn from tree to tree. Though it had been thrice explained to him, the lad hadn't fully grasped these forest fighting tactics.

He began advancing with Kushlova's direction / protection, and after what seemed like an eternity Kushlova and the lad burst behind a tree where a pair of enemies was hiding. Kushlova suprised the first man and a noiseless swing from his great mattock executed him. Meanwhile the lad let out a great swing of his broadsword wounding the other grievously. 

"Stand aside, I can finish this." he heard Kushlova saying, but the blood lust was upon him, and as soon as he'd recovered his weapon he was after his fallen foe. To late did he realize Kushlova was in the midst of binding the broken one as captive. As he executed the death blow he caught Kushlova's hands, mangling it irrepareably. From that time on Kushlova was known as the prince-wounded.

From the first clash the lad's men had worsted their foe, and the broken ones were already fully in a rout. When they returned to to camp with the lad was full of pride as cast the weapons of his fallen foe before his queen. To his suprise she met him with a mute silence. boldly, a retainter approached him, "Sir it not for the prince to cover his hands in blood, he must lead, he may fight, but he must never claim the weapons of a fallen foe."

The lad blushed with a mixture of pride and shame. His queen then accosted him. "You were the prince, but now you are a killer?" How can I abide with your shame? My only refuge now can be solitude.

Now dear reader, you might be confused and annoyed by the strange turn of events, yet it is the case that certain societies have a strict, if incomprehensible expectation of purity in the lives of their highest nobles. Such was the case of the ancient Persians who so respected kingly blood that should a prince be condemned to death, he would be killed with a silken cord so that no princely blood would be shed.

Faced by derision by his people and icy coldness from his Queen the prince had no choice but to leave his people and take to the life of a wanderer. Having hardly been a year in this strange world the lad would need all the fortune and guidance he could get to survive as a lone traveller. As he set out his mind was troubled by a thousand thoughts and emotions Though cast away from his people and his queen, the fire of a prince still burned in his heart and he yearned to reearn their trust and guide them once again.
