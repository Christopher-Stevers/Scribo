For this blog I've used the @11ty static site generator. I've heard great things about it, mostly on <https://shoptalkshow.com/> and was excited to try it out. It was fairly easy to get up and running, but wasn't the thirty minutes the clickbaitish youtube title claimed. I would recommend that you check out the corresponding this article by Koa Brook: <https://dev.to/koabrook/creating-a-basic-blog-with-eleventy-and-netlify-cms-completely-from-scratch-197e> . While I did use the tutorials quite heavily to create this blog I @11ty is a fairly straightforward technology, so I feel I can comfortably getting my hands dirty with it when I need to.

Content management and hosting are by Netlify, another shoptalkshow recommendation. As a beginner, I've found Netlify's hosting/DNS services very intuitive. There are lots of articles written on them and Netlify provides fairly good information as well.  For CMS integration I also refered to the article referenced above. Learning to work in .yml has been fun. At some point I will be adding more post types . . . maybe some cross-posting **to**--not from--twitter.\

If you have any ideas for this blog or comments on it, I'd love to hear from you at christopher.stevers@gmail.com. Also, if you like any help setting something similar up, I'd be glad to walk you through it.
