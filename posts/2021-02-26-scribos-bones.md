For this blog I've used the @11ty static site generator. I've heard great things about it, mostly on <https://shoptalkshow.com/> and was excited to try it out. It was fairly easy to get up and running, but wasn't the thirty minutes the clickbaitish youtube titles claimed. I would recommend that you check out the this article by Koa Brook: <https://dev.to/koabrook/creating-a-basic-blog-with-eleventy-and-netlify-cms-completely-from-scratch-197e> . As part of using eleventy I tried out the Nunjucks templating language which seems to be a favourite of the @11ty community. It is an interesting experience as my first templating language, and its neat to see the bonus powers Nunjucks has, beyond putting your content on the page. While I did use tutorials quite heavily on this project @11ty is a fairly straightforward technology, so I feel I can comfortably getting my hands dirty when I feel the need.

Content management and hosting are by Netlify, another ShopTalk Show recommendation. As a beginner, I've found Netlify's hosting/DNS services very intuitive. There are lots good articles n them and Netlify provides fairly good information as well.  For CMS integration I also referred to the article referenced above. Learning to work in .yml has been fun. At some point I will be adding more post types . . . maybe some cross-posting **to**--not from--twitter.\
