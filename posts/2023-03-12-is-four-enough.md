Intro

Tim Ferris' Four Hour Work week is a staple of the digital nomad / hustle culture of the digital age. In short the book paints a dream, to work four hours a week and live anywhere by leveraging technology, then in great detail it gives steps to fulfill it. Whether it is a feasible dream is dependant, of course, on circumstances and is a question for another day. Here I intend to tackle whether it is a dream worth striving for.

The key point, the underpining for all work which must be considered is why we work. Why do men devote 30, 40, or even 60 hours of every week to work? Tim's answer would be the plain and simple to create enough wealth to live as they wish. But rightly or wrongly this is not the pure reason why most men work. It is true that all do work to provide for themselves, but why they choose a particular business or job ( going forward I'll just use occupation) is dependant on a number of factors outside amassing the most money in the least amount of time. Some devote themselves to their occupation because they can't imagine anything better to do. This accounts for the passionate workers, and those who think themselves passionate. Some devote themselves to an occupation for the dream of attaining "financial freedom" for themselves and "smoothing" the way for the children. Many devote themselves to their occupation primarily because they must, and are either lacking the ability or will to change their position. For most its probably a mixture of these, at least to a degree. But why in fact should we work? Why should must we chase that dollar. Indeed why we work is only makes sense to serve that larger aim, the aim of our existence. Now if you can be convinced the aim of existence is, "To know, love, and serve God, and be happy with Him Heaven," why one works should be something like this: "to occupy ones time in a way that strikes an ideal balance between the ideal amount of temporal goods one needs, and the effect of ones occupation on oneself. According Ferris the first item on the scale ( earning enough money ) is possible to accomplish in a short time if we are willing to make some adjustments to the second item. As mentioned earlier, that is a question for another day. The second question is more obscure and more interesting at present, so lets jump in.

To start with the lowest stakes, what is the ideal occupation on the physical plane? Likely not as sedentary as yours, Western man ;P. But in all seriousness, the ideal occupation for physical health is , most importantly one which enables moderate physical exercise that's suited to one's age. This in means that ideally the job must be physical by nature, however in the case of less active work if one can exercise adequately either while working ( and yes you can code effectively with an under desk treadmill ) or after work the physical stimulus one's work gives becomes less important. Besides exercise it should be noted that, ideally, at least in the physical sense, one should be exposed to the minimum of workplace hazards, from dangerous chemicals to the boss's dog. Thus the "ideal" at least generally speaking is a fairly straightforward if we are optimizing for physical health alone, and likely your occupation doesn't quite fit this definition. But enough, lets move to the mental plane, perhaps the most important element in occupation and the thing middle class Westerners focus on when choosing their occupation.

Is four enough mentally, wouldn't you go stir crazy? Can you raise kids on a four hour work week?
Is four enough menatally. Will you be able to maintain spiritual sanity, and what are you doing with your time
