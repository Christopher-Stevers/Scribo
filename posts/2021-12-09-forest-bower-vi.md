The land they now traveled into was thick with forests and sloughs -- a dramatic change from the open spaces of their native land!\
The countless slooughes were a new challenge. They made the course into something of a maze. Whenever the forest opened they  would find themselves standing in water and muck. A wrong step could be the end of the unwary traveller here. The woodcraft of these people being strong, they could easily avoid the pitfalls around their path, but our lad was not yet trained in their ways. Once he as he slipped into the muck, he heard a call, "Woop, Woooop." He extricated himsle from the slop and, taking a couple of the natives left to investigate. As they picked their way around the sloughs it grew weaker, and they were lead deeper into the mists. Against his better judgement he followed it with his companions. The younger companion, Langstadt was wary of the swamps and wished to return, " Who knows we're we are in this mist? If the heat of theay overcomes us the muck may become are grave!"\

"I canna see so well, would you come closer me soon?"

Evidently the occupant hadn't gotten the message, but the lad humoured her and stepped in. No sooner had he crossed the trheshold than a knarled hand covered his mouth. "Don't struggle." whispered its owner. Not wanting to humour its owner, the lad struck behind him and wresteld with its grasp. But he was barely a match for his captor'

s brutal grasp. "Will you now be my son?" asked the wretched women; but the lad could think of no answher. At this she took a dagger from her garments. If thou wilt not be my blood, let me take yours. Under a foul force, the lad felt his own energy fading as she forgot her in infirmity and advanced toward him. \
Whatever devilish madness she was executing was interrupted by Langstatdt's voice. "Strike the witch
