Why, how could he even help lead a people who were so clearly wise beyond his understanding? His insane promotion complete, he turned to face the fair lady's people. \
"I will be a leader to you. What little I know, what little I can do will be in your service. Though I lack the age of your people, I will strive to make use of all my experience to guide and protect you." As he spoke, the young lad felt a love of these strange people bloom within him. It felt like something between the love of one's family and the one's country.  

The lady turned to her people, "It is now time to re-take the road. Let us proceed," and shouldered her own pack. Our lad took up his place beside her at the fore of the caravan and they set out. Though he had lived int his place his whole life, he was astonished by the hidden paths they traveled.  Not only did they avoid mankind's house's and settlements, they seemed to be under some ghostly veil. Animals gave them little notice and they tred on tender vegetation leaving nary a mark.  The caravan soon  happened upon a family of deer, and, instead of fleeing(deer's usual policy towards newcomers) the deer raised their heads and continued grazing.
