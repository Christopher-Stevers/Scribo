Now unmoored from his people, the lad spent months wandering the surrounding lands. He wanted nothing; between the provisions he'd be sent on his way and the fruit of his labours he was more than satisfied, but no he could not find a home. Eventually the lure of the great city of men, Illium pulled him away from the lands of the immortals, and he found himself among the dead-enders and wanders which grace all metropoles. It was no home to him, but in this milieu he found others in a similar plight and enough excitement to dull his loneliness.

One day, after a long night he found himself taking breakfast with an elderly wanderer - a true man of the road. They'd worked together for a few months, running carriages and other odd jobs, but today was Monday and was a holiday for them. As was his want the elder wanderer began sipped his coffee and began to tell a story of his travels.

"It was, in the year '29 when me and my brothers were in the service of the great king - for that was before the end of the kingdom of Illium, and we use to travel out of the city in search of tolls Some would think us highwaymen now, but we were in the service of the king and authorized to take suitable taxes from travellers, we would always give the king his share, and we were authorized to pocket the rest."

"So it happened that one night as we made our rest, a gang of true highwaymen set upon us, in search of our taxes no doubt, and we found ourselves in a desperate plight. We were holed up in a old fort outnumberd ten to one and with no hope of reaching the morning alive. Fortunately the old forts were well built so we hoped to knock out a few of the assailants before they took us out. I hit a few, wounding them with my javelins, while my brother held the door with his sword and great buckler. Then they began to throw missiles of their own into the fort. We thought for sure we were lost,it was only a matter of time until a rock dropped on one of us and knocked out. Then, you wouldn't believe it, but out of the darkness came a troop of fairies. They were real, I tell you, as real as you or I, but there dress and speech was what you'd imagine of fairies. Our assailants were as shocked as ourselves and were paralyzed for a second with fear, until the new comers began to deal with them with long, sleek knives. We then fell to our knees, thanking our rescuers, and hoping to escape the fate of our assailants. But it did not seem to be in the cards for us. We were bound and brought before the feet of their king, an ageless and venerable man.

He inquired of us, where we were born and what our employment. When we told him that we were servants of the great king he seemed neither impressed or disturbed, and he proceeded to sentence us to death. When we asked reason, we were told that we had profaned a sacred place. Apparently the fortification we were in was the ruins of a barrow to some ancient friends of these fairy-folk, whom I presume were blessed with agelessness. But seeing as it was a sacred place they dared not shed blood in its shadow without cause. To relieve us they had made an exception since our assailants would have been impossible to drive away without bloodshed. Our captors decided to brings us a days journey away so as not to desecrate the barrow. 

This is what saved us, since during the journey they made talked and made sport with us, and through it found pity from us. As we they prepared their tents for the night and the kings body-guard sharpened their knives. Just in time the daughter of the king, a princess of ageless beauty who had been among our companions that day, arrived and besought them to spare us for our ignorance.

"They are only mortals, what do they know?" she cried, and strove with them to have us released.

"But we have sworn to defend the graves of our ancient friends! Since they were from the people of death the least we can do is guard their graves from marauders and desecraters. 

"Desecerators? These men were fleeing for their lives. And they are mortals who do not know their own history. But they weren't trying to rob the barrow, I'm sure of that. Indeed it could be the grave of their ancestors.

Hearing the commotion the king came to the body guard, and hearing his daughter's entreaties he began to question us. When he realized how oblivious we were, he was gracious enough to release us, with the instruction to never again use the fortifications in that area. We were beyond relived, and when we had returned to Illium we soon gave up our post and found other employment. And that's how I found myself driving carriages for merchants instead of taxing them for the king. With that the old man finished with a smile.

The lad wasn't impressed by the incongruity of the story. Could this old crotchety man have been a servant of the king of Illium? Impossible. No one in the old days would have given that up for the rough life of a driver. "Impossible", its a fine yarn but you only wish it was your history. And fairies? That's a nice touch. Perhaps the lad had forgotten that he had been in the company of a people fitting the description of fairies just a few months ago.

"Hm, perhaps you don't belive me, but maybe you will." With that the man drew a light, ornate knife from deep within his garments. "The lady gave it to me as a token of her protection and begged me to pass it on to someone who needed it more in with the hope that person could repay her someday. I am old, taxiing ages us fast and I won't be here long. I wish to give it to you, you have a noble glint in your eye and I fear for your safety in our lowly company. The brawls which happen so frequently us "low life" could put you out of commission any day, and I hope you are made for greater things. Take this, and keep it well.

The lad took the beautiful weapon, and inspected. His eyes widened and his mouth dropped as he saw the markings on it. Inscribed deep in the hilt was a falcon, the simple of the immortals he'd so lately taken leave of. So once again he was bearing the arms of his people. 

A few weeks later the old man's forebodings came true and he died of a fainting fit. The lad continued taking odd jobs and running the taxis but he was once again resolved to raise himself to the place hinted at by the old man. And often he looked at this mysterious, beautiful weapon and wondered how, when, where would he ever use it.
