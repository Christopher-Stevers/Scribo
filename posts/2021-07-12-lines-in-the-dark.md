There lay a line in the night

Ethereal but strong as iron,

Seen only by intellects light,

Yet parting man from woman and father from son.

Who's sad design is this; pray tell?

Why are men divided from their most dear?

'Tis Fear alone that could this spell.

Oh that there were no reason to Fear. . . 

For 'tis a hard world, evil is oft abroad,

And without lines in the dark,

Who knows what the future might bode.

But this I know, so hark!

No fear should part forever,

The good man and his most dear.
