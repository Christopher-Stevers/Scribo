Upon a cold and moonless night a young lad walked beneath stars. As he went about his business he was pierced by the beauty of the cosmos around him. How bright the stars shone above him! No wonder the ancients had so many myths about the heavens! \
\
His musing upon the stars were distracted by a bright light from the ground. A bonfire? Not at this time of year! No drunken teenagers in woods with all this snow around. Besides it was clearer light than the familiar orange flame.\
This is where a conscientious man would return to his home and give little thought to the phenomena . . . or call the police. But our lad is hardly a conscientious man. He may be an adult but he still has the imagination of a lad. So, lad-logically, he starts of into the night to investigate with emotions of boyishness in his youthful breast.
