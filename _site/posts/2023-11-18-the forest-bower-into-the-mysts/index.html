<section><p><p>He had been a month on the road, and his head hung in dejection. Survival of the wilds, once tenuous, wasn't the issue. The knowledge and training he recieved from his people had prepared him amply for the challenges of the open road. While his life was still uncomfortable and occasionaly dangerous, his basic wants were <em>usually</em> furnished. Abundant game meant he rarely had to go hungry and the tent he'd brought from his camp was of fine tribal make so it provided shelter in all but the most violent tempests.</p>
<p>Security was a bit more concerning but his vulnerability as a target for brigands was offset by thin their tendency to prey on larger groups of travelers. The more victims, the more loot, was their logic. HE did hae a few close calls, but fortunately was able to escape with a mixture of speed, cunning and luck.</p>
<p>All in all he was a pretty well to do as far as vagabonds went in those days. Yet there was one obstacle he could not overcome and which he would need to find a way aroud if he ever wish to reunite with his people. Yeah, he would need to overcome it somehow or another if he ever wished to leave his solitary life.</p>
<p>His problem was queer one and he never would have foreseen in it when he was forced to embark on these adventures. He did not know how to communicate with the peoples inhabiting this different world he'd been in. While with his tribe there customs had influenced him in an almost magical way and he was able to fit in to there unique society even though he was, in truth a total foreigner.</p>
<p>Now that he no longer belonged to any group he found himself an alien to everyone. Sure he could speak there languages, that gift hadn't been removed from him when he was exiled. He could even get directions and carry out business with friendly travellers he came across. But he could not truly communicate with them beyond exchanging a few facts. And this meant he could not build the trust with anyone that would allow him to rejoin any society, not least his own tribe. Until he could truly communicate with them, or with someone he'd always be this lone wolf, who while amicable in the moment, was still a potential threat.</p>
<p>In that time and place through conflict, war, and displacement everyone had to operate under a suspicion that anyone who's was driven a different view of the world was a potential threat. Since he came from a vastly different world no one could truly understand his motives, his views. The cloak of protection and care he'd recieved from his initial tribe was gone now and it seemed that barring a miracle there was no way for him to regain it.</p>
<p>Let's see how our lad handled this by following him into the mysts of the wilds for some adventures.</p>
